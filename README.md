Dependancies: cryptography, pandas

## How to use

### Installation
```
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/robert-choi/password_storage.git

# change the working directory to sherlock
$ cd password_storage

# install python and pip if they are not installed

# install the requirements
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Initialization
To initiate, save passwords in the *old.txt* document with 
the formatting below:

```
Location:Userid:Password
```
**!** Note that spaces *are* supported, you have been warnd

Then, ensure that both the existant *pass_file* and non-
existant *crypt_file* variables are filled before running 
the script.

* When using for the first time, the entered password will 
be saved as the key for accessing the encrypted file. 
**This cannot be changed** afterwards. To be able to use a 
new password, *crypt_file* must be assigned to a non-
existant file.

* After initialization, a new *crypt_file* will be generated 
in the *passwerds* directory. This will contain all the 
password information within, to allow the original 
*pass_file* to be deleted if so desired.

### Usage
Use the parameter `cat` to view all saved passwords
